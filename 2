Question : which logic is implemented in the below code ?
            class User {
                public static void print() {
                    System.out.println("Inside user print");
                }
            
                public static void display() {
                    print();
                }
            }
            
            
            class Employee extends User {
                public static void print() {
                    System.out.println("Inside Employee print");
                }
            
                public static void display() {
                    print();
                }
            }
            
            
            class TestMain {
                static void main() {
                      User.display();
                      Employee.display();
            
                }
            }
sloution : Method  Hiding ( static methods cannot be overridden. When a subclass declares a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass, it is called "method hiding" rather than "method overriding.)
