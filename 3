Question : What will be the output of below code?
          import java.util.ArrayList;
          import java.util.Arrays;
          import java.util.List;
          
          class TestMain {
          
              public void test(List<Integer> integerList){
                  integerList.stream().map(a->{
                      System.out.println("value of a is : "+a);
                      return a.toString();
                  });
              }
              static void main() {
                  Integer input[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                  List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(input));
                  TestMain main = new TestMain();
                  main.test(integerList);
              }
          }

Answer : no output will be produced .
       Reason : Stream operations are lazy: The map operation in Java streams is an intermediate operation.
               Intermediate operations are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is called on the stream.
               Missing terminal operation: In the test method, the stream().map(...) call is not followed by any terminal operation
              (e.g., forEach, collect, toArray, reduce, etc.). Without a terminal operation, the map function, including the 
              System.out.println statement within it, will never be executed.
